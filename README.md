# stormwater_monitoring_exploration

Trying out extractions from field data form images for [Cascade STEAM](https://cascadesteam.org) Citizen Science group, for [RE Sources](https://www.re-sources.org) stormwater management project. This is a collaboration between me (@KalebCoberly) and Kris Keillor (@kriskeillor).

We'll wrap up a prototype walkthrough in an notebook called `extraction.ipynb`. We're using `exploration.ipynb` to try different approaches, with other notebooks to try pieces of it in parallel without making messy merges.

We also built out a data-definition sheet, `field_datasheet_data_definition.json` with sample extractions, and a sample expected extraction to test against in `expected_extractions/raw_ideal_form.json`, but we probably won't use those until we copy them over into an official repo to package up the pipeline for production.
